# BuildingManagementSystem

This project involves designing and implementing a database schema based on the specifications of a large project. The task included creating an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model, translating it into a relational model, generating SQL DDL scripts to create tables, and writing SQL DML scripts to populate the tables with meaningful test data.

## Project Description

The project required a thorough understanding of the system described in the specification. The main tasks included:

1. **Creating an EER Model**:
   - Developed an EER model to support the functional requirements specified in the documentation.
   - Ensured the model accurately represents the real-world system and its subsystems.

2. **Translating the EER Model to a Relational Model**:
   - Translated the EER model into a relational model, maintaining the integrity and relationships defined in the EER model.

3. **Generating SQL DDL Scripts**:
   - Created SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts based on the relational model to define the database schema.
   - Executed the DDL scripts to create the necessary tables in the database.

4. **Writing SQL DML Scripts**:
   - Developed SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) scripts to populate the tables with meaningful test data.
   - Ensured the test data accurately represents realistic scenarios for thorough testing of the database schema.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Specification**:
   - Carefully reviewed all sections of the specification, focusing on functional requirements to create an accurate EER model.
   - Gained a comprehensive understanding of the real-world system and its intended use of the information system.

2. **Creating the EER Model**:
   - Designed an EER diagram using appropriate entities, relationships, and attributes.
   - Included necessary constraints and cardinalities to accurately represent the system.

3. **Translating to a Relational Model**:
   - Converted the EER diagram into a relational schema.
   - Defined primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity and relationships.

4. **Generating DDL Scripts**:
   - Wrote SQL DDL scripts to create tables, indexes, and constraints based on the relational model.
   - Executed the scripts to create the database schema.

5. **Writing DML Scripts**:
   - Developed SQL DML scripts to insert, update, and delete data in the tables.
   - Populated the tables with meaningful test data to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable experience in database design and implementation, from conceptual modeling to physical database creation and data manipulation. By following the structured approach outlined in the specification, the project ensures a robust and well-defined database schema that supports the functional requirements of the system.
